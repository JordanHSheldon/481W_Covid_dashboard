                <p>
                    We use a flask frame work that pulls from a free
                    open covid api and then we arrange that data into an array,
                    pass that into html.

                </p>
                <h2>What is does the program do?</h2>

                    This website is a covid dashboard used to make it easier 
                    for the average person to find all the covid statistics they
                    are looking for in one place.
